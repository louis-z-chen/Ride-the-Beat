    <p>
      Spoke my mind but you stayed silent <br />
      No reply auto pilot <br />
      How could you cross me girl you aint even christian <br />
      This shit was toxic why do I miss it? <br />
      Tell me why  <br />
      This life in 3d and you show just one side  <br />
      Numb to my affection girl you paralyzed  <br />
      Keep it all inside  <br />
      Things change feelings fade and I've been on my own since then  <br />
      Without you it feels  <br />
      So strange so vacant but it aint worth the pain again  <br />
      Already broke my heart like one time  <br />
      Two times  <br />
      Im loosing count  <br />
      Oh my  <br />
      You love putting walls up  <br />
      Tear 'em all down  <br />
      Nike A1s  <br />
      Wear 'em all down  <br />
      Flashback to the summer takin trips in my Toyota  <br />
      Just bout drove off of the rockies we both though this life was over  <br />
      You broke me into pieces  <br />
      Still cant patch 'em up  <br />
      You'd send me hearts and peaches  <br />
      These days i pass 'em up  <br />
      I cant  <br />
      I cant seem to give you up  <br />
      Im way past giving up  <br />
      So shawty tell me why  <br />
      This life in 3d and you show just one side  <br />
      Numb to my affection girl you paralyzed  <br />
      Tell me was it all a lie  <br />
      All a lie  <br />
      All a lie  <br />
      Ooooo  <br />
      Things change feelings fade and ive been on my own since then  <br />
      Without you it feels  <br />
      So strange so vacant but it aint worth the pain again  <br />
      Already broke my heart like one time  <br />
      Two times  <br />
      Im loosing count  <br />
      Oh my <br />
